- Main() method is where your program starts running.
- while loop example
public class loopy {
public static void main {String[] args) {
int x = 1;
System.out.println("Before the loop");
while (x < 4) {
system.out.println("In the loop");
system.out.println("value of x is " + x);
x = x + 1;
}
System.out.println("This is after the loop");
}
- Instance variables - they represent an objects state (the data), and can have unique values for each objects of that type.
- Things an object can do are called methods.
- Things an object knows about itself are called instance variables.
- A class is a blueprint for an object
- Main is used for two reasos, to test your real class and to launch/start your java application
- Arrays are always objects, whether they're declared to hold primitives or object references.
-If you declare a method to return a value, you must return a value of the declared type.
